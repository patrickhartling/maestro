<h1><div align="center">Current Working Directory</div></h1>
<p>The current working directory identifies where in the file system the
command will be executed. This does not have to be the same as the directory
containing the command since the command can be specified using an absolute
path. As with the command, this path can vary based on classification of the
various cluster nodes.</p>
