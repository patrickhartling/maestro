An environment variable describes a setting that is applied to the execution
environment of the application. It is made up of a key (the name of the
environment variable) and a value. These settings are applied to the run-time
environment <em>of the application</em> on each of the remote nodes when the
application is launched. Environment variable values can reference other
environment variables using the syntax
<code class="literal">${ENV_VAR_NAME}</code> where
<code class="varname">ENV_VAR_NAME</code> is the name of the other environment
variable. Be careful not to introduce circular references, however, because
this will result in an infinite loop on the server side when trying to
resolve the references.</p>
