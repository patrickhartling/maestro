<h1><div align="center">Command Line Argument</div></h1>
<p>An argument describes a command line option to an application. This may
or may not have a flag (such as <code class="option">/f</code>,
<code class="option">-f</code> or <code class="option">--flag</code>), but
it always has a value. Arguments cannot have children but instead are the
children of groups and choices. Ultimately, these are what get passed to
the launched application based on the decisions of the user in the Launch
Viewer. Argument values can reference environment variables defined in the
stanza.</p>
