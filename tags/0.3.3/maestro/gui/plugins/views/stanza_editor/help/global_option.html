<h1><div align="center">Global Option</div></H1>
<p>A global option item is the root of an option tree that contains reusable
options that can be referenced by other global options and (most importantly)
by applications. Global options allow for centralization of common
site-specific options that can be reused rather than duplicated in other
stanzas.</p>
