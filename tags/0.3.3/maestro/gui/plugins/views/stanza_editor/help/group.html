<h1><div align="center">Group</div></h1>
<p>Creates a structural association of related items. Groups can encompass
other groups, choices, arguments, and/or environment variables.  Groups are
often used as children of choices when further nesting of choices is required.
Another common usage is to collect fixed settings behind a common facade.
For example, if there are four VR Juggler configuration files required for a
four-wall flexible wall projection system, two groups may be
&#8220;Walls Open&#8221; and &#8220;Walls Closed.&#8221; These groups need
not display that they are referencing four VR Juggler configuration files
and can instead be identified in the Launch Viewer as simply <b>Walls Open</b>
and <b>Walls Closed</b>.</p>
