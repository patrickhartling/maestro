      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Before we dive into explaining how to use Maestro, we first
      explain the purpose of the software and some history about how it came
      to be. The Maestro software is released under the terms of the GNU
      <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public
      License</ulink>, and the first version of the source was made available
      to the public in August 2006. As of this writing, the current version is
      0.1, and Maestro should be considered to be in a
      <quote>pre-alpha</quote> state. This means that the software will
      continue to evolve and improve with time. More information, including
      downloads, can be found at the <ulink
      url="https://realityforge.vrsource.org/trac/maestro/">Maestro
      website</ulink>.</para>

      <section>
         <title>What is Maestro?</title>

         <para>Maestro is a software package using a simple client/server
         model for utilizing the resources of a cluster of computers. Its
         current intended audience is owners of grahpics clusters (also known
         as image generator clusters) used for displaying high-quality,
         real-time graphics on multiple projection surfaces. As with most
         cluster-based technology, the idea is to spread the work load over
         many low-cost machines rather than using a single, expensive
         supercomputer. This means that distinct application processes are run
         on each node of the cluster, and there is typically some sort of
         communication between the processes or between the master node of the
         cluster and all the slave nodes. This communication is used for a
         variety of purposes including sending data and receiving
         results.</para>

         <para>Graphics clusters pose unique challenges. Most obviously, the
         software run on graphics clusters is normally interactive. Users
         provide live input and see immediate results, and to see the results,
         each node normally has one or more display devices (monitor or
         projector) connected to it. Furthermore, the processes running on
         each node normally work in concert to produce what appears to be a
         unified image rather than, say, each node working autonomously to
         compute a small part of a large problem. Thus, users of a graphics
         cluster are actively using all the nodes of the cluster
         simultaneously. This is in contrast to a computational cluster where
         a user sits down at the master node and starts up a computationally
         expensive job and then leaves the computers to run until the work
         completes.</para>

         <para>Users of graphics clusters should not have to sacrifice the
         simplicity of launching an application easily from the master node of
         the cluster, and this is where Maestro comes in. Rather than writing
         custom shell scripts or batch files and using remote shells to launch
         an interactive, immersive application, Maestro allows users to launch
         applications across all the nodes of a cluster in a simple, uniform
         manner. Maestro goes beyond just launching applications by providing
         extensions such as resource monitoring tools and cluster maintenance
         features. Users can write their own cluster-aware tools that plug in
         to Maestro in the form of a paired service and view. (More
         information on that is provided later in <xref
         linkend="chapter.extending.maestro" />.)</para>

      <section>
         <title>History</title>

         <para>Maestro was originally written by Aron Bierbaum at <ulink
         url="http://www.infiscape.com/">Infiscape Corporation</ulink> in
         January 2006 and was known simply as the <quote>Cluster Control
         Tool.</quote> It was born out of a need for improving the launching
         of <ulink url="http://www.vrjuggler.org/">VR Juggler</ulink>
         applications on clustersâ€”especially those running <productname
         class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname> where remote
         application execution is atypical. Existing techniques for launching
         such applications involved writing custom shell scripts or batch
         files for each application. Through varying means (SSH, <ulink
         url="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/PsExec.html">PsExec</ulink>,
         etc.), these scripts would get access to the nodes of the cluster and
         start the application process on each. To see the output from all the
         cluster nodes usually required having a console window open for each
         node (which was usually already open as a side effect of running the
         remote logon and launch commands). All in all, these techniques
         suffered from many limitations and complexities.</para>

         <para>Maestro has been designed from the start to address the
         limitations associated with more brute force approaches to launching
         immersive software applications on graphics clusters. Its
         client/server architecture eliminates the need for scripts that rely
         on remote logon in order to launch processes on the cluster nodes.
         Application-specific details are captured in XML files that can
         reference site-wide configuration information in order to avoid
         duplicating common information for every application. These XML files
         are processed in order to create a graphical launching interface on
         the fly that is (roughly) tailored to the application. The processes
         launched on the remote nodes are run as an authenticated user in
         order to provide controlled access to data files and to prevent
         security issues associated with remote code execution.</para>

      <section>
         <title>Getting Help</title>

         <para>Members of the Maestro community can post questions, feature
         suggestions, bug reports, etc. using the Maestro mailing lists. There
         are four lists, each with a different focus. The lists are managed by
         the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html">GNU
         Mailman</ulink> software, and subscribing and unsubscribing is done
         through an easy-to-use web interface. For each of the lists below, a
         link is provided to the page where users can subscribe or view the
         list archive to search old posts.</para>

               should subscribe to this list to keep up with releases as well
               as security notices. Since Maestro is designed to run as a
               service/daemon with elevated privileges, security is an
               important aspect of the software. Should a security problem be
               discovered, an announcement will be made on this list
               explaining the problem and providing a solution or workaround
               so that users are informed and can get the appropriate
               patches.</para>

               of this list is the development of the software itself. Topics
               would include low-level details about the software architecture
               and the overall design. Formal bug reports should be directed
               here to get the attention of the developers and to avoid
               cluttering the maestro-users list. Informal bug reports often
               come in the form of user questions, however, and those would
               normally go to the maestro-users list.</para>

      <title>Installation</title>

      <para>Maestro is a tool built on top of other tools. In order to install
      Maestro, its dependencies must be installed first. Since it is broken up
      into a client application and a server application, some nodes will not
      need all the dependencies. For example, a node that only runs the server
      application will not need the widget set (<ulink
      url="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</ulink>) used by the GUI.
      Similarly, a node that only runs the client GUI and not the server will
      not need the authentication modules.</para>

      <sidebar>
         <para>Much of the information here is provided for people who are
         working with an unpackaged version of Maestro. Due to the number of
         dependencies and the usual complexities involved with acquiring,
         building, and installing software, most users should get a
         pre-packaged version of Maestro and install it. A packaged version
         will include the dependencies in one form or another in order to ease
         the installation process.</para>

               <para>The Launch Viewer is likely to be the one seen most
               frequently by Maestro users. This module provides the end user
               interface to remote application launching. The interface itself
               is composed dynamically based on the configuration file (known
               as a <firstterm>stanza</firstterm>) for each application. This
               means that every application is likely to have a different
               launching interface in terms of options and parameters, and it
               is entirely up to each application author to devise a stanza
               that results in a clear, simple interface to launching an
               application. The interface for choosing which application to
               launch and the actual launch controls, however, will always be
               the same. In this section, we explain these
               application-agnostic controls as well as the basic controls
               that are available for stanza authors to utilize.</para>

               <para>The Reboot Viewer allows the GUI user to reboot
               individual nodes of the cluster or all the nodes of the cluster
               with the click of a button. When possible, the Reboot Viewer
               allows the GUI user to change the target operating system when
               rebooting so that it is not necessary to have direct access to
               the remote computer in order to change which OS it loads upon
               booting.</para>

               <important>
                  <para>Being able to change the target OS for rebooting
                  relies upon two things: knowledge of the boot loader on the
                  server side and access to the boot loader configuration from
                  all installed operating systems. Without both of these, it
                  is not possible to change the target OS. For example, if the
                  GRUB configuration file cannot be accessed from <productname
                  class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname>, then it
                  is not possible to change the default OS that GRUB boots
                  when the computer is currently booted into <productname
                  class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname>.
                  Similarly, if an unsupported boot loader is being used (such
                  as <productname class="trade">BootMagic</productname>), then
                  it is not possible to change the target OS at all. Support
                  for different boot loaders can be added as a plug-in to the
                  Maestro Reboot Service<indexterm>

         Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is
         released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
         definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
         Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the
         Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
         none.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-transparent">A "Transparent" copy of the Document

         or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
         drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
         for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
         variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made
         in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
         markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
         modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
         Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that

         Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
         Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
         edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the

         <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
         have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
         the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
         the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
         Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
         the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
         you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
         the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
         visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
         Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
         the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be
         treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</para>

         <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
         fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
         reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
         pages.</para>

         <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
         numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
         Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
         each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
         network-using public has access to download using public-standard
         network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
         of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
         reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
         copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
         thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after
         the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your
         agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>
