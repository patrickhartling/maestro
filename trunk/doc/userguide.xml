      <title>Preface</title>

      <para>Maestro was originally written by Aron Bierbaum at <ulink
      url="http://www.infiscape.com/">Infiscape Corporation</ulink> in January
      2006 and was known simply as the <quote>Cluster Control Tool.</quote> It
      was born out of a need for improving the launching of <ulink
      url="http://www.vrjuggler.org/">VR Juggler</ulink> applications<footnote>
            <para>Applications that present the user(s) with an interactive,
            immersive virtual space.</para>
         </footnote> on graphics clusters—especially those running
      <productname class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname> where
      remote execution of interactive applications is atypical. Existing
      techniques for launching VR Juggler applications involved writing custom
      shell scripts or batch files for each application. Through varying means
      (SSH, <ulink
      url="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/PsExec.html">PsExec</ulink>,
      etc.), these scripts would get access to the nodes of the cluster and
      start the application process on each. To see the output from all the
      cluster nodes usually required having a console window open for each
      node (which was usually already open as a side effect of running the
      remote logon and launch commands). All in all, these techniques suffered
      from many limitations and complexities. As we will see in this document,
      Maestro goes a long way to facilitating the easy use and maintenance of
      graphics clusters.</para>

      <para>Before we begin explaining Maestro and its use, we present the
      conventions used in this document in order for readers to get the most
      out of it. In some places, command lines are wrapped to keep the text
      within the margins of a page when this document is rendered to PDF. Such
      cases should be obvious to the reader, but it is important to understand
      that the command lines are intended to appear as a single line when
      used.</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Before we dive into explaining how to use Maestro, we first
      explain the purpose of the software and some history about how it came
      to be. The Maestro software is released under the terms of the GNU
      <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public
      License</ulink>, and the first version of the source was made available
      to the public in August 2006. As of this writing, the current version is
      0.1, and Maestro should be considered to be in a
      <quote>pre-alpha</quote> state. This means that the software will
      continue to evolve and improve with time. More information, including
      downloads, can be found at the <ulink
      url="https://realityforge.vrsource.org/trac/maestro/">Maestro
      website</ulink>.</para>

      <section>
         <title>What is Maestro?</title>

         <para>Maestro is a software package using a simple client/server
         model for utilizing the resources of a cluster of computers. Its
         current intended audience is owners of graphics clusters (also known
         as image generator clusters) used for displaying high-quality,
         real-time graphics on multiple projection surfaces. As with most
         cluster-based technology, the idea is to spread the work load over
         many low-cost machines rather than using a single, expensive
         supercomputer. This means that distinct application processes are run
         on each node of the cluster, and there is typically some sort of
         communication between the processes or between the master node of the
         cluster and all the slave nodes. This communication is used for a
         variety of purposes including sending data and receiving
         results.</para>

         <para>Graphics clusters pose unique challenges. Most obviously, the
         software run on graphics clusters is normally interactive. Users
         provide live input and see immediate results, and to see the results,
         each node normally has one or more display devices (monitor or
         projector) connected to it. Furthermore, the processes running on
         each node normally work in concert to produce what appears to be a
         unified image rather than, say, each node working autonomously to
         compute a small part of a large problem. Thus, users of a graphics
         cluster are actively using all the nodes of the cluster
         simultaneously. This is in contrast to a computational cluster where
         a user sits down at the master node and starts up a computationally
         expensive job and then leaves the computers to run until the work
         completes.</para>

         <para>Users of graphics clusters should not have to sacrifice the
         simplicity of launching an application easily from the master node of
         the cluster, and this is where Maestro comes in. Rather than writing
         custom shell scripts or batch files and using remote shells to launch
         an interactive, immersive application, Maestro allows users to launch
         applications across all the nodes of a cluster in a simple, uniform
         manner. Maestro goes beyond just launching applications by providing
         extensions such as resource monitoring tools and cluster maintenance
         features. Users can write their own cluster-aware tools that plug in
         to Maestro in the form of a paired service and view. (More
         information on that is provided later in <xref
         linkend="chapter.extending.maestro" />.)</para>

         <para>Maestro has been designed from the start to address the
         limitations associated with more brute force approaches to launching
         immersive software applications on graphics clusters. Its
         client/server architecture eliminates the need for scripts that rely
         on remote logon in order to launch processes on the cluster nodes.
         Application-specific details are captured in XML files that can
         reference site-wide configuration information in order to avoid
         duplicating common information for every application. These XML files
         are processed in order to create a graphical launching interface on
         the fly that is (roughly) tailored to the application. The processes
         launched on the remote nodes are run as an authenticated user in
         order to provide controlled access to data files and to prevent
         security issues associated with remote code execution.</para>

      <section>
         <title>Getting Help</title>

         <para>Members of the Maestro community can post questions, feature
         suggestions, bug reports, etc. using the Maestro mailing lists. There
         are four lists, each with a different focus. The lists are managed by
         the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html">GNU
         Mailman</ulink> software, and subscribing and unsubscribing is done
         through an easy-to-use web interface. For each of the lists below, a
         link is provided to the page where users can subscribe or view the
         list archive to search old posts.</para>

               should subscribe to this list to keep up with releases as well
               as security notices. Since Maestro is designed to run as a
               service/daemon with elevated privileges, security is an
               important aspect of the software. Should a security problem be
               discovered, an announcement will be made on this list
               explaining the problem and providing a solution or workaround
               so that users are informed and can get the appropriate
               patches.</para>

               Discussion and question &amp; answer forum for users. This is
               the best place to go for help with Maestro. Given a large
               enough community of users, this is the list that would have the
               most traffic as users discuss the software as well as ask and

               Discussion for Maestro developers and contributors. The focus
               of this list is the development of the software itself. Topics
               would include low-level details about the software architecture
               and the overall design. Formal bug reports should be directed
               here to get the attention of the developers and to avoid
               cluttering the maestro-users list. Informal bug reports often
               come in the form of user questions, however, and those would
               normally go to the maestro-users list.</para>

      <title>Installation</title>

      <para>Maestro is a tool built on top of other tools. In order to install
      Maestro, its dependencies must be installed first. Since it is broken up
      into a client application and a server application, some nodes will not
      need all the dependencies. For example, a node that only runs the server
      application will not need the widget set (<ulink
      url="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</ulink>) used by the GUI.
      Similarly, a node that only runs the client GUI and not the server will
      not need the authentication modules.</para>

      <sidebar>
         <para>Much of the information here is provided for people who are
         working with an unpackaged version of Maestro. Due to the number of
         dependencies and the usual complexities involved with acquiring,
         building, and installing software, most users should get a
         pre-packaged version of Maestro and install it. A packaged version
         will include the dependencies in one form or another in order to ease
         the installation process.</para>

         <para>Maestro is open source software, and it can be obtained
         directly from its <ulink
         url="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</ulink> repository.
         This is done using the following command:</para>

         <screen>svn co https://realityforge.vrsource.org/svn/maestro/trunk maestro</screen>

         <para>As of this writing, there are no branches or tags to retrieve,
         so the trunk is the only path to get source.</para>

         <sidebar>
            <para>The certificate used for Subversion access on <ulink
            url="https://realityforge.vrsource.org/">RealityForge</ulink> is
            not signed by a certificate authority. As a result, users must
            accept the certificate manually the first time they connect. A
            message similar to the following will be displayed:</para>

            <screen>Error validating server certificate for 'https://realityforge.vrsource.org:443':

         <para>Releases of Maestro are distributed in various ways. The source
         is packaged up as compressed <command>tar</command>(1) archives and
         as ZIP archives. On UNIX-based operating systems, a simple makefile
         is provided for installing into <filename>/usr</filename> or into a
         user-specific prefix. This makefile has very limited capabilities and
         currently exists primarily to help out automated packaging tools such
         as <command>rpmbuild</command>(1). Nevertheless, to use this makefile
         to install into <filename>/usr</filename>, simply run the following
         from the root of the Maestro source tree using GNU Make:</para>

         <screen>make install</screen>

         <para>To install Maestro into a different location (such as
         <filename>/usr/local</filename>), run the following instead:</para>

         <screen>make prefix=/usr/local confdir=/usr/local/etc install</screen>

         <para>For Linux distributions that use the Red Hat Package Manager
         (RPM) for package management, <filename>.rpm</filename> files are
         prepared. The Maestro RPMs are not specific to any distribution or
         Python version, but the dependencies are. As such, it is important to
         get the right dependencies for the Linux distribution where Maestro
         will be used. There are four or five RPMs depending on whether the
         documentation RPM was built, and they are as follows:</para>

         <filename>/usr/lib/maestro-X.Y.Z</filename> (where
         <quote>X.Y.Z</quote> is the Maestro version number such as 1.0.1) and
         run the script <command>mkpem</command> as root. This will generate a
         file named <filename>server.pem</filename> that is the machine
         certificate for that instance of the Maestro daemon. The certificate
         can be reused with future Maestro installations, though it will
         expire two years after the date of creation.</para>

         <para>If the <filename>maestro-server</filename> package is being
         upgraded, the existing <filename>server.pem</filename> file should be
         moved into the new Maestro installation directory. The
         <filename>maestro-server</filename> RPM does not claim ownership of
         the <filename>server.pem</filename> file, so it does not get removed
         when the package is erased.</para>

         <para>On <productname class="registered">Microsoft
         Windows</productname>, an automated installer is provided. Currently,
         this installer includes all the dependencies
         <emphasis>except</emphasis> Python and <ulink
         url="http://pywin32.sourceforge.net/">pywin32</ulink>. These must be
         installed separately before Maestro is installed.</para>

         <important>
            <para>In order to use the installation wizard, Python 2.4 is
            required. It is hoped that this limitation will be fixed in a
            future release. If the installation wizard is not used and Maestro
            is installed manually, then Python 2.4 or Python 2.5 is
            recommended. Remember that all dependencies must be built using
            the same version of Python.</para>

         <para>After installing the <application>Maestro GUI</application>

         <title>Using the Maestro Server</title>

         <para>The server side of the Maestro software is an application
         called <command>maestrod</command> (pronounced
         <quote>maestro-dee</quote>). On <productname
         class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname>, it runs as a
         service as the SYSTEM user; on other platforms, it runs as a daemon
         as root. In this section, we explain how to use
         <command>maestrod</command>.</para>

         <section id="section.running.maestrod">
            <title>Running <command>maestrod</command></title>

            <para>In general, maestrod will be running as a background
            service/daemon that users do not need to worry about starting and
            stopping. Nevertheless, to get a complete understanding of how
            Maestro works, it is useful to understand how the server side is
            managed. Below, we explain how the Maestro service is installed
            and started on <productname class="registered">Microsoft
            Windows</productname> and then how the Maestro daemon is installed
            on managed on Linux.</para>

            <section>

                  class="registered">Windows</productname> service</secondary>
               </indexterm>

               <para>On <productname class="registered">Microsoft
               Windows</productname>, the automated installer sets up the
               Maestro service and starts it running. Hence, by using that
               installer, there is nothing further that has to be done in
               order to run maestrod on that platform. However, if the
               installer was not used, the process of installing and starting
               the service is quite simple. As a user with administrative
               privileges, simply run the following in the directory
               containing the Maestro distribution:</para>

               <indexterm>
                  <primary>maestrod</primary>

               <screen>maestrod.py --interactive --startup auto install
maestrod.py start</screen>

               <para>Should it become necessary to remove the service, run
               these commands as a user with administrative privileges in the
               directory containing the Maestro distribution:</para>

               <indexterm>
                  <primary>maestrod</primary>

                  <secondary><productname

               <para>Running <command>maestrod</command> as a service causes
               it to be run as the SYSTEM user. In general this is how most
               people would run <command>maestrod</command> since that user
               has all the necessary privileges in order for the Maestro
               software to work. Sometimes it is useful to run
               <command>maestrod</command> in debug mode, but doing this
               requires that the logged on user have the necessary privileges
               to spawn processes as other users and to impersonate other
               users. To get these privileges, follow these steps:</para>

               <para>Maestro is packaged up for deployment on Linux using RPM
               files. For the server side, there are two packages to install:
               maestro-base and maestro-server. The maestro-base package
               contains the core Python code that is used by both
               <command>maestrod</command> and the Maestro client GUI;
               maestro-server contains all the server-side code, scripts, and
               data files. When the maestro-server package is installed on
               Linux, there is a shell script added to
               <filename>/etc/init.d</filename> called

            <filename>/etc</filename>. It uses XML, but its form is quite
            flexible. This flexibility is offered to allow service plug-in
            authors (see <xref linkend="section.extending.services" />) to
            configure their plug-ins in the manner that best suits their

               <para>When <command>maestrod</command> is running on a
               operating system that uses the X Window System, the
               authenticated user must be allowed to open windows on the local
               X server. This is done by granting modifying the authenticated
               user's <filename>~/.Xauthority</filename> file to include the
               local X server's authorization key using the
               <command>xauth</command>(1) command. To avoid tying
               <command>maestrod</command> to any specific operating system
               installation or site configuration, the path to
               <command>xauth</command>(1) and the local X server's Xauthority
               file are configurable. For example, we see in <xref
               linkend="example.maestrod.xcfg.rhel4" /> how to configure
               maestrod to run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4. For Fedora Core
               5, the configuration is slightly different, as seen in <xref

               url="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/">GDM</ulink> (the GNOME
               Display Manager) is being used as the X display manager. The
               path to the Xauthority file would differ if using <ulink

               <para>The GRUB plug-in itself looks at maestrod.xcfg for

               the <sgmltag>&lt;grub_conf&gt;</sgmltag> XML element. Examples
               of configuring the Reboot Service for GRUB and the NT Loader
               are shown in <xref

               <para>Being able to change the target OS for rebooting relies
               upon two things: knowledge of the boot loader<indexterm>
                     <primary>boot loader</primary>
                  </indexterm> on the server side and access to the boot
               loader configuration from all installed operating systems.
               Without both of these, it is not possible to change the target
               OS. For example, if the GRUB configuration file cannot be
               accessed from <productname class="registered">Microsoft
               Windows</productname>, then it is not possible to change the
               default OS that GRUB boots when the computer is currently
               booted into <productname class="registered">Microsoft
               Windows</productname>. Similarly, if boot loader is being used
               that is unknown to the Reboot Service<indexterm>

                  </indexterm>), then it is not possible to change the target
               OS at all. Support for different boot loaders can be added as a
               plug-in to the Maestro Reboot Service<indexterm>

               <para>Given these constraints, it is vital to make the boot
               loader configuration editable by all operating systems on the
               computer. If there is only one OS involved, then the default
               installation of the boot loader will be fine. (For a computer
               that only has <productname class="registered">Microsoft
               Windows</productname> installed, there may not be any obvious
               use of a boot loader even though it is present and involved
               with the boot process every time.) For multiple operating
               systems, however, things get more complicated. Below, we
               provide recommendations for how to make supported boot loaders
               work with Maestro and its rebooting capabilities.</para>

                  directory <filename>/boot/grub</filename>. Depending on how
                  things were installed, this may be in its own partition or
                  in the partition containing the root Linux file
                  system.</para>

                  rebooting into any of the operating systems known to GRUB.
                  Getting <filename>grub.conf</filename> and all the other
                  GRUB files into a location that is readable and writable by
                  all installed operating systems is the tricky part.
                  Fortunately, GRUB comes with support for many file system
                  types, so it can be installed just about anywhere. At the
                  same time, <productname class="registered">Microsoft
                  Windows</productname> does not include support for many file
                  system types, so it becomes the limiting factor. The lowest
                  common denominator among most modern operating systems and
                  GRUB is the FAT32 file system. By (re-)installing GRUB into
                  a FAT32 partition, the <filename>grub.conf</filename> file
                  will be readable and writable by all operating systems and
                  by GRUB at boot time.</para>

                  <caution>
                     <para>The process for installing GRUB into a FAT32 file
                     system manually is not difficult, but it requires care.
                     If the boot blocks of a disk are not set up properly, the
                     computer will be rendered unbootable, so having a
                     recovery CD that can reinstall some boot loader (such as
                     the default Master Boot Record [MBR] or GRUB's first
                     stage loader) is highly recommended. Furthermore, a good
                     understanding of how boot loaders and boot blocks work
                     will come in very handy if anything should go
                     wrong.</para>
                  </caution>

                  <para>The first step of installing GRUB onto a FAT32
                  partition is to create the partition. It does not need to be
                  large (a GRUB installation requires roughly 200 kB of
                  storage), and since the partition may be used for other
                  things that just giving GRUB a home, users should consider
                  carefully just how large to make it. For the purposes of
                  this discussion, let us say that the FAT32 partition is the
                  third primary partition on the first hard disk. In <ulink
                  url="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Naming-convention.html#Naming-convention">GRUB
                  terminology</ulink>, this makes it partition (hd0,2). The
                  actual disk and partition used will vary from site to
                  site.</para>

                  <important>
                     <para>It is highly recommended that the FAT32 partition
                     be created as part of setting up the computer rather than
                     as an afterthought. However, this is not always possible,
                     and in that case, the FAT32 partition should go
                     <emphasis>after</emphasis> the existing primary
                     partitions on the hard disk where it is created. (It does
                     not have to be on the first disk.) Doing it this way
                     prevents the BIOS partitions from being renumbered which
                     would cause existing boot loader configurations. This is
                     because boot loaders generally rely upon BIOS partition
                     ordering to know which OS to load.</para>
                  </important>

                  <para>Once the partition is created, the existing GRUB
                  installation needs to be copied into the directory. In most
                  cases, GRUB will only be accessible from a non-<productname
                  class="registered">Windows</productname> platform, so the
                  FAT32 partition must be mounted under the operating system
                  where the GRUB files are currently installed. Let us assume
                  that the GRUB files are currently available under /boot/grub
                  and that the new FAT32 partition is mounted at /mnt. The
                  following commands (run as root or another user with write
                  access to <filename>/mnt</filename>) copy the existing GRUB
                  files to the FAT32 partition where they need to be:</para>

                  <screen>mkdir -p /mnt/boot/grub
cp -r /boot/grub /mnt/boot/grub</screen>

                  <para>The <filename>grub.conf</filename> file that gets
                  copied as part of this will continue working since we have
                  not changed any partition numbering.</para>

                  <para>When we are finished, the old
                  <filename>/boot/grub</filename> will no longer be the valid
                  GRUB installation. For that reason, the FAT32 partition must
                  be mounted when the non-Windows operating system is booted
                  (add an entry to <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> to do
                  this), and the <filename>/boot/grub</filename> directory
                  should be moved out of the way to be replaced with a
                  symbolic link. For example, let us say that the FAT32
                  partition will be mounted under <filename>/fat32</filename>
                  every time the computer boots. In that case, the following
                  command would set up the new
                  <filename>/boot/grub</filename>:</para>

                  <screen>cd /boot
mv grub grub-off
ln -s /fat32/boot/grub ./</screen>

                  <para>Next, a GRUB <ulink

                  trying to modify <filename>boot.ini</filename> from another
                  operating system such as Linux. There is a freely available
                  <ulink url="http://www.linux-ntfs.org/">Linux kernel
                  module</ulink> that adds support for accessing NTFS
                  partitions. While reading from an NTFS partition in Linux
                  works very well, writing is still considered to be
                  dangerous. File system corruption resulting from writing to
                  an NTFS partition from Linux is something that is well
                  within the realm of possibility. Nevertheless, the <ulink

                  is a path rather than an index, the likelihood of changing
                  the size of <filename>boot.ini</filename> in order to modify
                  the default setting is quite high. Therefore, it is vital
                  that resizing of existing files in an NTFS partition from
                  Linux be supported.</para>

                  <para>An alternative to using the Linux kernel module is to
                  use <ulink

                  It is a more fully featured approach to accessing NTFS
                  partitions from Linux, though it tends to have slower
                  performance than the kernel module. Resizing of files always
                  works with ntfsmount, and if performance is not a concern
                  for accessing the NTFS partition, then it would probably be
                  a safer approach. Documentation is provided on the <ulink

               This is made possible through the use of a collection of

                  <para>Screen savers and power management are very common
                  features of modern operating systems. Both, however,
                  interfere with the usage of graphics applications that are
                  run on clusters. We do not want a screen saver to activate
                  or a screen to go black in the middle of running a VR
                  demonstration as it would, among other things, ruin the
                  suspension of disbelief. The Desktop Service uses one or
                  more plug-ins to disable and deactivate screen savers and

                  to change the power-off timeout for a monitor drawing AC
                  power. It does this by switching time timeout value between
                  0 minutes (no power off) and some other number of minutes.
                  The plug-in will query the current power-off timeout setting
                  when the Maestro service is launched and use that as the
                  non-zero value. However, if the power-off timeout is 0 when
                  the Maestro service starts, then it falls back on a
                  twenty-minute timeout. This may not be appropriate, and the

                  we see that the power-off timeout can be set to some number
                  of minutes explicitly. This value can be set to 0 to prevent
                  the powercfg plug-in from enabling the power-off timeout
                  altogether, though in this case, it may be better to set the

         <title>Using the <application>Maestro GUI</application>
         Client</title>

         <para>The client side of Maestro is a cross-platform GUI written in
         the Python programming language with PyQt as the widget set. As we
         will see, it is designed to be a dynamic and flexible interface for
         utilizing a cluster.</para>

         <para>Before we get into the usage of the <application>Maestro
         GUI</application>, we must introduce some terminology. In keeping
         with the musical theme of Maestro, there are two data files (XML
         files) utilized by the <application>Maestro GUI</application>:
         ensemble files and stanza files. An
         <firstterm>ensemble</firstterm><indexterm>
               <primary>ensemble</primary>

               <secondary>definition of</secondary>
            </indexterm> file identifies the nodes of the cluster, and in the
         usage of Maestro, we frequently refer to the cluster nodes together
         as an ensemble. The name ensemble was chosen because it represents a
         group of musicians who perform together—an apropos choice in the
         context of a graphics cluster.</para>

         <para>The <firstterm>stanza</firstterm><indexterm>
               <primary>stanza</primary>

               <secondary>definition of</secondary>
            </indexterm> file describes how to run an application. If we
         consider that running an application is the performance of the
         cluster, then this name is quite meaningful. The term stanza also has
         relevance in the realm of computing where it is <quote>a block or
         subsection of a human-readable configuration file for computer
         software.</quote> Application developers write stanza files by
         filling in the executable name, command line options, and any
         environment variables needed to launch the software. The stanza file
         is then used by the <application>Maestro GUI</application> to
         construct a graphical interface for that application in the Maestro
         Launch Viewer (see <xref linkend="section.viewer.launch" />). Thus,
         it is up to the stanza author to create a stanza that results in an
         understandable, flexible user interface when loaded by the
         <application>Maestro GUI</application>.</para>

            <title>Running the <application>Maestro GUI</application></title>

            <para>To load the <application>Maestro GUI</application>, run the
            command <command>maestro</command> or double-click on the
            application icon. A splash screen appears while all the
            dynamically loaded code and data files are loaded. Next, a login
            dialog is displayed asking for the user name, the password, and
            (optionally) the <productname class="registered">Microsoft
            Windows</productname> domain for the user who will be launching
            applications on the cluster. At this time, the login information
            must be the same for all nodes of the ensemble, and a user cannot
            authenticate as a different person without restarting the
            <application>Maestro GUI</application>.</para>

            <sidebar>
               <para>Once the user enters his or her password, the
               authentication process starts for each of the nodes, and it
               continues asynchronously while the GUI is in use until login
               completes on all the nodes in the ensemble. If login access is
               denied on a node, the user will be presented with a dialog box
               asking him or her if reauthentication should be performed. If a
               node cannot be contacted for logging in, the process will be
               reattempted in the background periodically until it succeeds.
               Furthermore, if a server node goes down and comes back up after
               login takes place, the user will be reauthenticated with the
               server automatically without any further necessary action on
               the part of the user.</para>

               <para>The <option>-e/--ensemble</option> option names an
               ensemble file to load when the <application>Maestro
               GUI</application> starts. Using this option eliminates the need
               to open an ensemble after the GUI opens, but it does not
               preclude the user from changing the current ensemble (as we
               will see in <xref linkend="section.gui.ensemble.load" />). One
               use of this command line option would be in the context of
               associations that cause the <application>Maestro
               GUI</application> to load when a user double-clicks on a file.
               The file association action could include this option to cause
               a specific ensemble to be loaded by default so that the
               <application>Maestro GUI</application> automatically connects
               to a cluster when it opens.</para>

               are treated as positional arguments. Positional arguments are

               <para>Using any of these names on a command line would require
               proper quoting to avoid misinterpreting the space in the viewer
               name. For example, here is one way that the
               <application>Maestro GUI</application> could be launched as a
               result of a file association on <productname
               class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname> (the wrapped
               line is to facilitate rendering rather than to indicate
               syntax):</para>

               <screen>maestro.py --ensemble="C:\site\cluster.ensem"
           --stanza="C:\apps\myapp.stanza" --view="Launch View"</screen>

               <para>A simpler form of the same is the following:</para>

               <screen>maestro.py --view="Launch View" C:\site\cluster.ensem
           C:\apps\myapp.stanza</screen>

               <para>By using the short form of the <option>-v/--view</option>
               option, we can shrink the command line a little further, as
               shown below:</para>

               <screen>maestro.py -v "Launch View" C:\site\cluster.ensem
           C:\apps\myapp.stanza</screen>

               <para>We will see in <xref linkend="section.maestro.config" />
               how this command can be simplified further through the
               <application>Maestro GUI</application> configuration. By
               configuring the <application>Maestro GUI</application>
               appropriately, we can avoid having to list the ensemble file
               every time the GUI is launched. Moreover, site-wide and
               user-specific extensions to the stanza search path can
               eliminate the need to name any stanza files on the command line
               in many cases.</para>

               <indexterm class="startofrange"

                  <tertiary><option>-o/--override</option></tertiary>
               </indexterm>

               <para>The <option>-o/--override</option> option offers a great
               deal of power to users of the <application>Maestro
               GUI</application>, though its use is by no means simple. Later,
               in <xref linkend="section.stanza.items" />, we will explain how
               one stanza file entry can reference <emphasis>and</emphasis>
               refine content from one or more other stanza entries. Reusing
               stanza constructs from files is a very static process, however,
               and this is not always sufficient. The
               <option>-o/--override</option> offers some of this same
               functionality by allowing the <application>Maestro
               GUI</application> user to change the behavior of a stanza when
               the GUI is launched.</para>

               <para>To understand when this overriding behavior can be
               useful, consider the case of a clustered application that loads
               a data file. This data file determines what the application
               will display. To make things simple for new users, the stanza
               file for this application defines a default data file. In this
               way, a single click of the Launch button is sufficient to get
               the application running. More experienced users may have their
               own data files, however, and they would like to be able to use
               them by double-clicking on the data file. To make this work, a
               file association would need to be created between the data file
               type and the <application>Maestro GUI</application>. In our
               file association setup, we can use the
               <option>-l/--launch-only</option> option to restrict what
               application can be launched and the <option>-v/--view</option>
               option to go straight to the Launch View. The only remaining
               step is to replace the default data file option in the stanza
               with the file name provided through the double-click launch
               operation, and this is where the <option>-o/--override</option>
               option plays a role.</para>

               <para>Without getting into the details of the stanza file
               format at this point (refer to <xref
               linkend="section.files.stanza" /> for more on that topic), let
               us assume that we have the stanza file shown in <xref
               linkend="example.stanza.file.simple" />. Notice that the root
               <sgmltag>&lt;stanza&gt;</sgmltag><indexterm>
                     <primary>stanza</primary>

                     <secondary>elements</secondary>

                     <tertiary><sgmltag>&lt;stanza&gt;</sgmltag></tertiary>
                  </indexterm> XML element has an attribute called
               <literal>namespace</literal> and that each XML element under
               the <sgmltag>&lt;stanza&gt;</sgmltag> root has an attribute
               called <literal>name</literal>. These attributes are used in
               constructing the path to an entry in the stanza, and we can use
               the <option>-o/--override</option> with any child of the
               <sgmltag>&lt;stanza&gt;</sgmltag> root, no matter how deeply
               nested it may be. In this case, we need to change the path to
               the data file based on what is provided through the file
               association action. The path to the data file item is
               <literal>mine:app/input</literal>, and we need to change the
               CDATA for that XML element. To do this, the command line option
               would be similar to <literal>-o
               "mine:app/input?cdata=/path/to/myfile.ext"</literal>. In the
               context of a file association action, the syntax depends on
               what operating environment is being used. For example, a
               Windows Registry association would for this case would be
               <literal>-o "mine:app/input?cdata=%1"</literal>, and a <ulink
               url="???">freedesktop.org</ulink> association would be
               <literal>-o "mine:app/input?cdata=%f"</literal>. (Details on
               setting up file association actions are well beyond the scope
               of this document.)</para>

               <example id="example.stanza.file.simple">
                  <title>Basic Stanza File</title>

                  <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;stanza namespace="mine"&gt;

      &lt;/arg&gt;
   &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/stanza&gt;</programlisting>
               </example>

               <para>The behavior of the <option>-o/--override</option> option
               is not limited to changing the CDATA of an XML element. Any
               attribute of the identified element can be changed using the
               syntax <literal>path?attr=value</literal> where
               <literal>path</literal> is a valid stanza ID path,
               <literal>attr</literal> is the name of the attribute (such as
               <literal>class</literal>, <literal>label</literal>, etc.) and
               <literal>value</literal> is the new value for the named
               attribute. Multiple overrides can be performed on a stanza
               entry using a single <option>-o/--override</option> option or
               by repeating the ID path in multiple
               <option>-o/--override</option> options. To see how we can do
               this using a single <option>-o/--override</option> option, let
               us say that we want to change the command line flag used to
               name the data file to be loaded from <option>-d</option> to
               <option>--input</option> in addition to our override from
               above. In this case, the option for use in the Windows Registry
               would be <literal>-o
               "mine:app/input?cdata=%1&amp;flag=--input"</literal> and
               <literal>-o
               "mine:app/input?cdata=%f&amp;flag=--input"</literal> for a
               freedesktop.org association. The key point here is the use of
               the <literal>&amp;</literal> character to separate multiple
               overrides for a single ID path. (That and we slipped in an
               example of how to change the value of an XML attribute.)</para>

               path. Only the root of the hierarchy need be named in order for

               <para>The Launch Viewer is likely to be the one seen most
               frequently by Maestro users. This module provides the end user
               interface to remote application launching. The interface itself
               is composed dynamically based on the configuration file (known
               as a <firstterm>stanza</firstterm>) for each application. This
               means that every application is likely to have a different
               launching interface in terms of options and parameters, and it
               is entirely up to each application author to devise a stanza
               that results in a clear, simple interface to launching an
               application. The interface for choosing which application to
               launch and the actual launch controls, however, will always be
               the same. In this section, we explain these
               application-agnostic controls as well as the basic controls
               that are available for stanza authors to utilize.</para>

               <section>
                  <title>Basic Launch Controls</title>

                  <para>At the top of the Launch Viewer panel is a pull-down
                  menu that lists all the known applications. Recall that the
                  applications are described using stanzas, so this pull-down
                  menu lists all the loaded stanzas. By selecting an
                  application in the Launch Viewer, the user is indicating
                  which application will be launched.</para>

                  <para>At the bottom of the Launch Viewer, there are three
                  buttons at the bottom of the panel:
                  <guibutton>Launch</guibutton>,
                  <guibutton>Terminate</guibutton>, and
                  <guibutton>Help</guibutton>. The
                  <guibutton>Launch</guibutton> button tells all the remote
                  nodes to run the command with the options provided by the
                  user. The <guibutton>Terminate</guibutton> button kills the
                  launched application. The <guibutton>Help</guibutton> button
                  loads HTML help associated with the selected application (as
                  specified in its stanza file). The
                  <guibutton>Help</guibutton> button is only enabled when an
                  application stanza includes information about where to find
                  the HTML help.</para>

                  <para>When an application is launched, any output that it
                  would normally write to a console window is streamed back to
                  the <application>Maestro GUI</application> and displayed in
                  the tabbed panel of log windows. This panel is normally at
                  the bottom of the <application>Maestro GUI</application>.
                  Note that each tab can be detached from the
                  <application>Maestro GUI</application> and moved &amp;
                  resized independently. This allows the output from multiple
                  nodes to be seen simultaneously if so desired. Otherwise, as
                  a tabbed panel, it offers a very compact view of the log
                  output.</para>

                  <para>The output from the launched application is also
                  written to node-specific log files in the user's home
                  directory. In some instances, it may be necessary or useful
                  to save this output. This can be done at any time by
                  selecting the <menuchoice>
                        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

                        <guimenuitem>Archive Logs</guimenuitem>
                     </menuchoice> item or by clicking the <guibutton>Archive
                  Logs</guibutton> tool bar button. A file chooser dialog will
                  open asking the user to name the file used for the archive.
                  Upon choosing a file, the log files are collected into a ZIP
                  archive.</para>

               <section>
                  <title>Application Option Controls</title>

                  <para>To manipulate the launch options for an application, a
                  basic set of controls are used. These controls are
                  structured based on the stanza file. The GUI layout for the
                  Launch Viewer will reflect the nesting and grouping of
                  options as they are specified in the stanza. The controls
                  used are the following:</para>

                        paths, etc. In the case of a file path, the stanza
                        author may choose to indicate that a file chooser
                        dialog box can be opened. Should that information be
                        present in the stanza, a button will be placed to the
                        right of the text field for opening the file chooser
                        dialog.</para>

               <para>As we noted earlier, the system-wide and user-specific
               <application>Maestro GUI</application> configuration files are
               merged into one at run time with the user settings taking
               precedence over system-wide settings. This means that the
               user-specific <application>Maestro GUI</application> file can
               contain the same XML tags as the system-wide file. In this
               subsection, we explain how to utilize this feature to extend
               and override system-wide settings and to control behavior of
               the <application>Maestro GUI</application> that would usually
               not be appropriate for system-wide settings.</para>

               <sidebar>
                  <para>Recall that the user-specific <application>Maestro
                  GUI</application> settings are in a file named maestro.xml
                  that is located in a platform-specific directory. For
                  Microsoft Windows, the file is either
                  <filename>%APPDATA%\Maestro\maestro.xml</filename> or
                  <filename>%USERPROFILE%\Application
                  Data\Maestro\maestro.xml</filename>. For Mac OS X, the file
                  is <filename>$HOME/Library/Application
                  Support/maestro.xml</filename>. For all other platforms, it
                  is <filename>$HOME/.maestro/maestro.xml</filename>.</para>
               </sidebar>

               <para>The first user-specific setting that we will examine is
               the user-defined stanza search path. If set, this list of
               directories is the <emphasis>first</emphasis> searched when
               scanning for <filename>.stanza</filename> files (refer back to
               <xref linkend="section.stanza.search.path" /> for more
               details). The user-defined stanza search path is set using the

               platform-specific list of directories separated by the
               platform-specific path separator character
               (<literal>;</literal> on <productname
               class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname> and
               <literal>:</literal> on all other platforms). A convenient use
               of this setting is when several applications are being
               developed in the user's home directory. While the
               <filename>.stanza</filename> files for the applications could
               be found using the <envar>STANZA_PATH</envar> environment
               variable or the <option>-s/--stanza</option> command line
               option, this setting would tend to be more practical for a
               sufficiently large number of application directories to
               scan.</para>

               <para>In some cases, the user may wish to prevent the
               <application>Maestro GUI</application> from scanning
               directories for <filename>.stanza</filename> files. This can be
               accomplished by overriding the system-wide stanza search path
               and/or by preventing the scanning the default stanza search

               <para>Finally, the <application>Maestro GUI</application> has
               three settings that fall under the category of <quote>user
               preferences</quote>: the user skill level, the directory where
               the log files get stored during execution, and whether to
               delete these log files when the GUI exits. The GUI does not yet
               provide a graphical means to edit these preferences, so users
               must edit <filename>maestro.xml</filename> by hand. An example
               version of this file is shown in <xref
               linkend="example.maestro.gui.config" />.</para>

               the lack of a setting (in this case, the user skill level) is
               not a problem. Reasonable defaults exist for the current
               settings, and there is not usually a need to override the
               defaults by adding to this file. The defaults for the settings

      <title>Maestro Files</title>

      <para>Aside from preferences or configuration files, there are two data
      files utilized by Maestro: ensembles and stanzas. These files were
      introduced earlier in <xref linkend="section.usage.gui" />, and we go
      into more detail about their use and how to edit them in this chapter.
      These files are loaded by the <application>Maestro GUI</application>, so
      all users of the <application>Maestro GUI</application> will have some
      interaction with them. However, not all users will have to know how
      interpret or edit the contents of these files. We explain more in the
      following sections.</para>

      <section id="section.files.ensemble">
         <title>Ensembles</title>

         <indexterm class="startofrange" id="index.file.ensemble">

            <secondary>file</secondary>
         </indexterm>

         <para>Ensemble files (having the extension
         <filename>.ensem</filename> or <filename>.ensemble</filename>)
         identify the nodes of a cluster. When the <application>Maestro
         GUI</application> loads an ensemble file, it tries to connect to the
         <command>maestrod</command> process running on each of the identified
         nodes. The structure of these files is very simple, and the example
         included with the Maestro source is shown in <xref
         linkend="example.maestro.ensemble" />. The root XML node must be
         <sgmltag>&lt;ensemble&gt;</sgmltag><indexterm>
               <primary>ensemble</primary>

               <secondary>elements</secondary>

               <tertiary><sgmltag>&lt;ensemble&gt;</sgmltag></tertiary>
            </indexterm>, and it has one level child nodes that are
         <sgmltag>&lt;cluster_node&gt;</sgmltag><indexterm>
               <primary>ensemble</primary>

               <secondary>elements</secondary>

               <tertiary><sgmltag>&lt;cluster_node&gt;</sgmltag></tertiary>
            </indexterm> elements. The <sgmltag>&lt;cluster_node&gt;</sgmltag>
         elements have three attributes: <literal>class</literal>,
         <literal>hostname</literal>, and <literal>name</literal>. The
         <literal>class</literal> is a comma-separated list of identifiers
         indicating the role of the node in the cluster, and it comes into
         play with the stanzas and application launching. Common values are
         <literal>master</literal> or <literal>slave</literal><indexterm>
               <primary>ensemble</primary>

            </indexterm>. By default, every node in the ensemble has its
         operating system name as part of its class, so this need not (and
         should not) be specified in the ensemble file. The
         <literal>hostname</literal> is the IP address or machine name for the
         node. This is what the <application>Maestro GUI</application> uses
         for making the connection to the remote node. Finally, the
         <literal>name</literal> is a <quote>friendly</quote> identifier for
         the node that is used whenever the nodes of the ensemble are
         displayed in the <application>Maestro GUI</application>.</para>

         <para>Ensemble files can be edited by hand using a text editor or by
         using the <application>Maestro GUI</application>'s ensemble editor.
         This editor is integrated into the Ensemble Viewer (first introduced
         in <xref linkend="section.viewer.settings" />). This viewer has
         controls for adding nodes to and removing nodes from the loaded
         ensemble. After making edits to the ensemble, it can be saved using
         the <menuchoice>
               <guimenu>File</guimenu>

               <guimenuitem>Save Ensemble</guimenuitem>

         <para>Generally, an ensemble would be edited once per cluster when
         setting up Maestro for use with that cluster. An administrator would
         put the ensemble file in a place that is convenient for accessing by
         all users of the cluster. At this time, the <application>Maestro
         GUI</application> does not have a way to name a default ensemble to
         load, but this capability will be added in a future release.</para>

            <secondary>file</secondary>
         </indexterm>

         <para>The other type of file utilized by the <application>Maestro
         GUI</application> is known as a stanza. Every application that can be
         launched by Maestro must be described using a stanza. Stanzas are
         discovered dynamically when the <application>Maestro
         GUI</application> is launched or by using the
         <option>--stanza</option> command line option.</para>

         <para>Stanza files are XML files, and their structure is quite
         complex. They have a high degree of flexibility that allows
         arbitrarily deep nesting and references to external stanzas. Due to
         their complexity, we refrain from going into detail about the format
         here and instead concentrate on how to use the stanza editor.</para>

         <indexterm class="startofrange" id="index.file.stanza.edit">

            <secondary>file</secondary>

            <tertiary>editing</tertiary>
         </indexterm>

         <para>The stanza editor is one of the <application>Maestro
         GUI</application> viewer plug-ins. It is currently the only viewer
         that does not have a corresponding service since it does not do
         anything with the ensemble. Thus, it is not necessary to have an
         ensemble loaded in order to edit stanza files. There are two items in
         the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu related to stanza editing:
         <menuchoice>
               <guimenu>File</guimenu>

               <guimenuitem>Load Stanza</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice> and <menuchoice>
               <guimenu>File</guimenu>

               <guimenuitem>Save All Stanzas</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>. The stanza editor itself contains a button
         <guibutton>New Application</guibutton> for creating a new application
         stanza from scratch.</para>

         <para>Since stanzas describe a hierarchy of options and environment
         variables, the idea behind the editor is to represent that hierarchy
         in an understandable yet powerful manner. A simple graph structure is
         used to achieve this. The parent/child relationships are represented
         by arrows between nodes of the graph. Each node of the graph
         represents an XML element, and the attributes of the XML element are
         editable in the dockable panel at the bottom of the stanza editor.
         This panel is dockable so that it can be detached from the
         <application>Maestro GUI</application> and resized independently as
         necessary.</para>

         <para>Application developers would create a stanza file for their
         application when the application is deployed for use at a site that
         is already running Maestro. The site-specific details (such as what
         VR Juggler configuration to load) can be referenced by a stanza, but
         in general, a stanza file for an application will vary from one site
         and one cluster to another. Since the variation is captured in the
         stanza file, however, it is much easier to deploy cluster-ready
         applications than writing a custom launch solution for each
         site.</para>

                  <tertiary><sgmltag>&lt;global_option&gt;</sgmltag></tertiary>
               </indexterm>). Stanza items define the behavior of how an
            application gets executed by capturing details such as the command
            to run, command line flags, and execution environment. The
            composition of this information at launch time is done by making
            choices in the Launch Viewer<indexterm>
                  <primary>viewers</primary>

                  <secondary>launch</secondary>
               </indexterm> of the <application>Maestro GUI</application>.
            There are many stanza items, and we explain their usage in this
            section.</para>

            <para>Some stanza items can reference environment variables in
            their value setting. The environment variable can be one that is
            set as part of the stanza itself, as part of a the environment of
            referenced global options, or as part of the execution environment
            on the remote computer. This is done using the syntax of UNIX
            shells where <literal>${ENV_VAR}</literal> indicates that the
            value of the environment variable <literal>ENV_VAR</literal>
            should be used. The environment variable evaluation happens on the
            remote computer as part of launching.</para>

            <para>In the stanza editor, there is a tool bar containing all the
            information that can go into a stanza. The tool bar items are as
            follows:</para>

            <itemizedlist>

                        <secondary>command</secondary>
                     </indexterm>: A command is what actually gets executed
                  when the application is launched. The command path should
                  <emphasis>not</emphasis> be enclosed in quotes even when it
                  contains spaces because the Maestro Launch Service<indexterm>
                        <primary>services</primary>

                        <secondary>launch</secondary>
                     </indexterm> will handle using correct quoting when
                  necessary. The command can set using one or more environment
                  variables.</para>

                  <para>The executed command can be varied on each node of the
                  cluster using the <literal>class</literal> attribute. For
                  example, on a cluster that mixes <productname
                  class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname> and
                  Linux, a command might be <filename>C:\Program

                  <filename>/usr/local/bin/myprog</filename> on others. In
                  this case, two commands are needed for the two variations
                  with the former using <quote>Windows XP</quote> as its class
                  and the latter using <quote>Linux.</quote> Refer to <xref

                     </indexterm>: An environment variable describes a setting
                  that is applied to the execution environment of the
                  application. It is made up of a key (the name of the
                  environment variable) and a value. These settings are
                  applied to the run-time environment <emphasis>of the
                  application</emphasis> on each of the remote nodes when the
                  application is launched by merging the stanza environment
                  with the run-time environment of the Maestro server.
                  Environment variable values can reference other environment
                  variables using the syntax
                  <literal>${ENV_VAR_NAME}</literal> where
                  <varname>ENV_VAR_NAME</varname> is the name of the other
                  environment variable. Be careful not to introduce circular
                  references, however, because this will result in an infinite
                  loop on the server side when trying to resolve the
                  references. The value of an environment variable in the
                  remote execution environment can be modified (extended or
                  replaced) using this stanza item. For example,
                  <envar>PATH</envar> could be changed to

                  cases, an application may use a large collection of
                  environment variables, and creating individual environment
                  variable items in the stanza can be quite tedious. Instead,
                  an environment variable list can be used to capture multiple
                  environment variables in one place. Each environment
                  variable in the list is made up of a (the name of the
                  environment variable) and zero or more values. If the stanza
                  author allows the user to change the value of the
                  environment variable, multi-valued variables will be
                  presented using a combo box or an editable combo box when
                  appropriate.</para>

                  <para>The environment variables in the list are applied to
                  the run-time environment <emphasis>of the
                  application</emphasis> on each of the remote nodes when the
                  application is launched by merging the stanza environment
                  with the run-time environment of the Maestro server.
                  Environment variable values can reference other environment
                  variables using the syntax
                  <literal>${ENV_VAR_NAME}</literal> where
                  <varname>ENV_VAR_NAME</varname> is the name of the other
                  environment variable. Be careful not to introduce circular
                  references, however, because this will result in an infinite
                  loop on the server side when trying to resolve the
                  references. The value of an environment variable in the
                  remote execution environment can be modified (extended or
                  replaced) using this stanza item. For example,
                  <envar>PATH</envar> could be changed to
                  <literal>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/bin:${PATH}:${HOME}/somedir/bin</literal>.</para>

                        <secondary>argument</secondary>
                     </indexterm>: An argument describes a command line option
                  to an application. This may or may not have a flag (such as
                  <option>/f</option>, <option>-f</option>, or
                  <option>--flag</option>), but it always has a value.
                  Arguments cannot have children but instead are the children
                  of groups and choices. Ultimately, these are what get passed
                  to the launched application based on the decisions of the
                  user in the Launch Viewer. Argument values can reference

                        <secondary>choice</secondary>
                     </indexterm>: Creates a structural item containing a list

                  or more arguments, and/or one or more environment variables.
                  When using a mutually exclusive choice, either radio buttons
                  or a combo box (also known as a pull-down menu) can be used
                  for showing the options. Which type to use is up to the
                  stanza author, but authors should keep in mind that combo
                  boxes are much better when there are many (more than three
                  or four) possible options.</para>

                     </indexterm>: Creates a structural association of related
                  items. Groups can encompass other groups, choices,
                  arguments, and/or environment variables. Groups are often
                  used as children of choices when further nesting of choices
                  is required. Another common usage is to collect fixed
                  settings behind a common facade. For example, if there are
                  four VR Juggler configuration files required for a four-wall
                  flexible wall projection system, two groups may be
                  <quote>Walls Open</quote> and <quote>Walls Closed.</quote>
                  These groups need not display that they are referencing four

                        <secondary>reference</secondary>
                     </indexterm>: A reference allows reuse of a structural
                  item in another stanza. References can be refined by using
                  add, remove, and override operations as the children. A
                  reference has an identifier that uniquely describes what XML
                  element in another stanza is being referenced. This
                  identifier is formed using a syntax similar to <ulink
                  url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</ulink>, though it is
                  <emphasis>not</emphasis> XPath. The path has a root and
                  children that are separated by the <literal>/</literal>
                  character, and a reference identifier must include both. In
                  other words, referencing only the root is not valid. The
                  root node itself may have a namespace that is used to assist
                  with creating unique identifiers. For example, two root
                  nodes might be <literal>site1:VrJugglerOptions</literal> and
                  <literal>site2:VrJugglerOptions</literal> where
                  <literal>site1</literal> and <literal>site2</literal> (the
                  namespaces) are common identifiers for two different VR
                  installations in the same organization.</para>

                  <para>The reference identifier is used for matching purposes
                  within the collection of all known stanzas. To perform this
                  matching, the identifier can utilize the Python regular
                  expression syntax. For those users not familiar with regular
                  expressions, simpler shell-style glob patterns are allowed.
                  For example, valid paths (those containing a root and
                  references to one or more children) from our example above
                  might be <literal>site1:VrJugglerOptions/*</literal> or
                  <literal>site1:VrJugglerOptions/Input*</literal>. To index
                  within a collection of matches returned by a pattern, the
                  syntax is to use the <literal>@</literal> symbol followed by
                  a zero-based integer index. For example,
                  <literal>site1:VrJugglerOptions/Input*@2</literal> would
                  extract the third child under
                  <literal>site1:VrJugglerOptions</literal> whose name matches
                  <literal>Input*</literal>.</para>

                        <secondary>override</secondary>
                     </indexterm>: An override changes a detail of a
                  referenced structural item. This can include XML attributes
                  and the CDATA of the referenced element. The overriding is
                  based on the same identifier syntax as a reference
                  identifier, although the path is now relative to the root of
                  the referenced item(s). One possible use of overrides is to
                  change how a collection of site-wide arguments are passed in
                  to an application. For example, a site may have many VR
                  Juggler configuration files required to launch applications.
                  In the site's global options, these files are described as
                  arguments with no flag, but some applications require a
                  command line option to identify the meaning of an argument.
                  Those cases can be handled by overriding the
                  <literal>flag</literal> attribute on all the arguments for
                  VR Juggler options in the case of the applications that

                  structural item by defining more children such as groups,
                  choices, arguments, and environment variables. The exact
                  result of the add operation depends on what structural item
                  is being referenced. Additions can be in the form of
                  choices, groups, environment variables, environment variable
                  lists, and/or arguments.</para>

                        <secondary>remove option</secondary>
                     </indexterm>: A remove operation deletes a child of the
                  referenced structural item. The reference identifier uses
                  the same path syntax as its parent reference, but the path
                  in this case is relative to the parent. In the event that
                  the path matches multiple nodes, the individually matched
                  roots can be matched using the <literal>@</literal> indexing
                  syntax. For example, if the parent reference identifier
                  <literal>site1:VrJugglerOptions/Input*</literal> matches
                  <literal>site1:VrJugglerOptions/InputGlove</literal>,

                  <literal>site1:VrJugglerOptions/InputWand</literal>, the
                  second of those can be removed by using
                  <literal>@1</literal> as the identifier.</para>

            <para>Stanza items can have a class setting that dictates how the
            item is used on a given remote computer. As we saw in <xref
            linkend="section.files.ensemble" />, every node in the ensemble
            has a class setting, and a matching process is followed to
            determine if a stanza item is to be used with the ensemble node.
            The matching is fairly simple. If all the class tokens of a stanza
            item match up with class tokens of the ensemble node, then the
            stanza item is used with that ensemble node. The more class tokens
            used on a stanza item, the more specific the matching with
            ensemble nodes will be. A stanza item with an empty class setting
            therefore matches all ensemble nodes.</para>

               <para>It is not valid to set the operating system class token
               for the nodes of an ensemble file. This information is
               determined by Maestro so that nodes can be rebooted to a
               different operating system without requiring a change to the

               GUI</application>. The ability of the <application>Maestro

            <para>With that, let us now consider the example stanza shown in

            version of <filename>stanzas/DirectoryListing.stanza</filename> in
            the Maestro installation tree). In this case, the stanza provides
            a way to list a user-specified directory on the remote machine.
            Since the command for doing this varies between operating systems,
            there are platform-specific command stanza items (XML tag
            <sgmltag>&lt;command&gt;</sgmltag><indexterm>
                  <primary>stanza</primary>

            other words, the <literal>class</literal> attribute on the
            &lt;command&gt; tag is set to <literal>Linux</literal> for the
            Linux case and to <literal>Windows XP</literal> for the
            <productname class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname>
            case. The ensemble nodes that running Linux at the time this
            application gets launched will receive the Linux command, and
            those running Windows XP will receive the Windows XP command. If
            all the nodes are running (say) Linux, then the Windows XP command
            will not be sent to any ensemble node.</para>

            <para>The next point of variation in this example is the argument
            used for the command. Since path syntax varies between platforms,
            we allow the user to enter the platform-specific syntax in the

                  <primary>viewers</primary>

                  <secondary>launch</secondary>
               </indexterm>. (The user can do this because the

            <para>A second item of interest for the

            the <literal>flag</literal> attribute is varied. To get a
            <quote>long</quote> directory listing from <command>ls</command>,
            we pass the <option>-l</option> option. The <command>dir</command>
            command, on the other hand, will give us the long listing by
            default, so no additional flag is needed.</para>

            <para>As we noted in <xref linkend="section.files.ensemble" />,
            common class settings for ensemble nodes include
            <literal>master</literal> and <literal>slave</literal>. These
            classes allow application launching to determine when it is
            running on a <quote>master</quote> node of the cluster versus a
            <quote>slave.</quote> For VR Juggler 2.0 and 2.2, the notion of a
            master cluster node is a rather weak one, but application
            developers may structure their software in such a way that
            different code gets run on different nodes based on the role of
            the node in the cluster. The <literal>class</literal> attribute on
            stanza items allows Maestro to handle this case.</para>

            <para>Consider the example shown in <xref
            linkend="example.stanza.classes.master.slave" />. In this case, we
            have the following variations based on operating system and
            ensemble node role:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
               <listitem>
                  <para>The path to the command is different based on the

                  <para>The arguments passed to the commands are different

               </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>The variation in the command is captured using the
            <sgmltag>&lt;command&gt;</sgmltag><indexterm>
                  <primary>stanza</primary>

                  <secondary>elements</secondary>

                  <tertiary><sgmltag>&lt;command&gt;</sgmltag></tertiary>
               </indexterm> tag and its <literal>class</literal> attribute.
            For the master node, we run <command>masterApp</command> whereas
            the slave nodes all run <command>slaveApp</command>. Note that
            both of these stanza items reference the environment variable
            <envar>APP_DIR</envar>. This environment variable is used to
            capture the platform-specific path to the executable. The two

                  <tertiary><sgmltag>&lt;env_var&gt;</sgmltag></tertiary>
               </indexterm> tags have their <literal>class</literal> attribute
            set to a platform-specific value. In this way, we avoid having to
            include the operating system in the <literal>class</literal>
            attribute for the <sgmltag>&lt;command&gt;</sgmltag> tags so that
            we may have two <sgmltag>&lt;command&gt;</sgmltag> tags instead of
            four. Next, both the master and the slave applications take the
            same VR Juggler configuration file. We do this using an
            <sgmltag>&lt;arg&gt;</sgmltag><indexterm>
                  <primary>stanza</primary>

                  <secondary>elements</secondary>

                  <tertiary><sgmltag>&lt;arg&gt;</sgmltag></tertiary>
               </indexterm> tag with an empty class setting so that it matches
            all ensemble nodes. Finally, the slave application needs to be
            told the address of the master for making the network connection.
            This is done by using another <sgmltag>&lt;arg&gt;</sgmltag> tag
            whose <literal>class</literal> attribute is set to
            <literal>slave</literal>.</para>

         <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
         other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom:
         to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
         with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
         Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a
         way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
         responsible for modifications made by others.</para>

         <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
         derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
         sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
         copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

         <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
         for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
         free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
         that the software does. But this License is not limited to software
         manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
         matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend
         this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
         reference.</para>

         <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

         <para id="gfdl-doc">This License applies to any manual or other work,
         in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
         saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
         notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
         duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The
         "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of
         the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the
         license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring
         permission under copyright law.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-mod-ver">A "Modified Version" of the Document means
         any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
         verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
         language.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-secnd-sect">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix
         or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with
         the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
         Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
         nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus,
         if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
         Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
         matter of historical connection with the subject or with related
         matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political
         position regarding them.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-inv-sect">The "Invariant Sections" are certain
         Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
         Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is
         released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
         definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
         Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the
         Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
         none.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-cov-text">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages
         of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in
         the notice that says that the Document is released under this
         License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover
         Text may be at most 25 words.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-transparent">A "Transparent" copy of the Document
         means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
         specification is available to the general public, that is suitable
         for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors
         or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
         drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
         for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
         variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made
         in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
         markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
         modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
         Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that
         is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

         <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
         plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
         SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
         simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
         Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
         Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
         edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the
         DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
         machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
         processors for output purposes only.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-title-page">The "Title Page" means, for a printed
         book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed
         to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the
         title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as
         such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance
         of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
         text.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-entitled">A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named
         subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or
         contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in
         another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name
         mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
         "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a
         section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section
         "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

         <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the
         notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These
         Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
         this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
         implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
         no effect on the meaning of this License.</para>

         <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

         <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
         commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
         copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
         to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
         other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
         technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
         copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
         compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
         number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
         3.</para>

         <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
         above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="gfdl-3">
         <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

         <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
         have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
         the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
         the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
         Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
         the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
         you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
         the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
         visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
         Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
         the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be
         treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</para>

         <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
         fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
         reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
         pages.</para>

         <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
         numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
         Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
         each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
         network-using public has access to download using public-standard
         network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
         of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
         reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
         copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
         thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after
         the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your
         agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

         <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
         of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
         copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version
         of the Document.</para>

         all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
         notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>

         <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License,
         and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
         single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same
         name but different contents, make the title of each such section
         unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
         original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
         unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the
         list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined
         work.</para>

         <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
         "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
         Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
         "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must
         delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</para>

      <section id="gfdl-6">
         <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

         <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
         documents released under this License, and replace the individual
         copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
         that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
         rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
         in all other respects.</para>

         <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
         distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
         copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
         License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
         document.</para>

      <section id="gfdl-7">
         <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>

         <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
         separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
         storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
         copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
         legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
         works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
         License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are
         not themselves derivative works of the Document.</para>

         <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
         these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
         half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
         placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or
         the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
         form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the
         whole aggregate.</para>

      <section id="gfdl-8">
         <title>TRANSLATION</title>

         <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
         distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
         Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
         permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
         translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
         original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
         translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
         Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
         include the original English version of this License and the original
         versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement
         between the translation and the original version of this License or a
         notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>

         <para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
         "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
         its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
         title.</para>

         <title>TERMINATION</title>

         <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
         Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any
         other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document
         is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
         License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
         you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
         long as such parties remain in full compliance.</para>

         <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

         <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
         of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
         versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
         differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
         http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</para>

         <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
         number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version
         of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
         option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified
         version or of any later version that has been published (not as a
         draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not
         specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
         ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
         Foundation.</para>

         <title>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</title>

         <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a
         copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright
         and license notices just after the title page:</para>

         <blockquote id="copyright-sample">
            <title>Sample Invariant Sections list</title>

            <para>Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
            distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
            Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version
            published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant
            Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of
            the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
            Documentation License".</para>
         </blockquote>

         <para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and

         <blockquote id="inv-cover-sample">

            <para>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
            the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
            being LIST.</para>
         </blockquote>

         <para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some
         other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit
         the situation.</para>

         <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code,
         we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice
         of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
         permit their use in free software.</para>
