<h1><div align="center">Environment Variable</div></h1>
<p>An environment variable describes a setting that is applied to the
execution environment of the application. It is made up of a key (the name
of the environment variable) and a value. These settings are applied to the
run-time environment <em>of the application</em> on each of the remote nodes
when the application is launched by merging the stanza environment with the
run-time environment of the Maestro server. Environment variable values can
reference other environment variables using the syntax
<code class="literal">${ENV_VAR_NAME}</code> where
<code class="varname">ENV_VAR_NAME</code> is the name of the other environment
variable. Be careful not to introduce circular references, however, because
this will result in an infinite loop on the server side when trying to resolve
the references. The value of an environment variable in the remote execution
environment can be modified (extended or replaced) using this stanza item.
For example, <code class="envar">PATH</code> could be changed to
<code class="literal">${VJ_BASE_DIR}/bin:${PATH}:${HOME}/somedir/bin</code>.</p>
