<h1><div align="center">Current Working Directory</div></h1>
<p>The current working directory identifies where in the file system the
command will be executed. This does not have to be the same as the
directory containing the command since the command can be specified using
an absolute path. As with the command, this path can vary based on
classification of the various cluster nodes. The current working directory
can be set using one or more environment variables.</p>
