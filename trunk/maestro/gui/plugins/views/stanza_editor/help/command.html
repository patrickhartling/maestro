<h1><div align="center">Command</div></h1>
A command is what actually gets executed when the application is launched. The
command path should <em>not</em> be enclosed in quotes even when it contains
spaces because the Maestro Launch Service will handle using correct quoting
when necessary. The executed command can be varied on each node of the
cluster using the <code class="literal">class</code> attribute. For example,
on a cluster that mixes Microsoft Windows&reg; and Linux, a command might be
<code class="filename">C:\Program Files\Software\myprog.exe</code> on some
nodes and <code class="filename">/usr/local/bin/myprog</code> on others. In
this case, two commands are needed for the two variations with the former
using &#8220;Windows XP&#8221; as its class and the latter using
&#8220;Linux.&#8221;
