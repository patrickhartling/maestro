<h1><div align="center">Environment Variable List</div></h1>
<p>A list of environment variables. In some cases, an application may use a
large collection of environment variables, and creating individual environment
variable items in the stanza can be quite tedious. Instead, an environment
variable list can be used to capture multiple environment variables in one
place. Each environment variable in the list is made up of a (the name of the
environment variable) and zero or more values. If the stanza author allows the
user to change the value of the environment variable, multi-valued variables
will be presented using a combo box or an editable combo box when
appropriate.</p>
<p>The environment variables in the list are applied to the run-time
environment <em>of the application</em> on each of the remote nodes when the
application is launched. Environment variable values can reference other
environment variables using the syntax
<code class="literal">${ENV_VAR_NAME}</code> where
<code class="varname">ENV_VAR_NAME</code> is the name of the other environment
variable. Be careful not to introduce circular references, however, because
this will result in an infinite loop on the server side when trying to resolve
the references.
