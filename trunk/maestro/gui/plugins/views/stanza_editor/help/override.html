<h1><div align="center">Override</div></h1>
An override changes a detail of a referenced structural item. This can
include XML attributes and the CDATA of the referenced element. The overriding
is based on the same identifier syntax as a reference identifier, although the
path is now relative to the root of the referenced item(s). One possible use of
overrides is to change how a collection of site-wide arguments are passed in
to an application. For example, a site may have many VR Juggler configuration
files required to launch applications. In the site's global options, these
files are described as arguments with no flag, but some applications require
a command line option to identify the meaning of an argument. Those cases can
be handled by overriding the <code class="literal">flag</code> attribute on
all the arguments for VR Juggler options in the case of the applications that
require it.
