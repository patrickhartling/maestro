<h1><div align="center">Add Option</div></h1>

An add operation extends a referenced structural item by defining more
children such as groups, choices, arguments, and environment variables. The
exact result of the add operation depends on what structural item is being
referenced. Additions can be in the form of choices, groups, environment
variables, environment variable lists, and/or arguments.
