<h1><div align="center">Choice</div></h1>
Creates a structural item containing a list of choices, either mutually
exclusive or not. Choices can encompass one or more groups, one or more
other choices, one or more arguments, and/or one or more environment
variables. When using a mutually exclusive choice, either radio buttons or
a combo box (also known as a pull-down menu) can be used for showing the
options. Which type to use is up to the stanza author, but authors should
keep in mind that combo boxes are much better when there are many (more
than three or four) possible options.
