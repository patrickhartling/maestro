<h1><div align="center">Reference</div></h1>
<p>A reference allows reuse of a structural item in another stanza. References
can be refined by using add, remove, and override operations as the children.
A reference has an identifier that uniquely describes what XML element in
another stanza is being referenced. This identifier is formed using a syntax
similar to XPath, though it is <em>not</em> XPath. The path has a root and
children that are separated by the <code class="literal">/</code> character,
and a reference identifier must include both. In other words, referencing
only the root is not valid. The root node itself may have a namespace that is
used to assist with creating unique identifiers. For example, two root nodes
might be <code class="literal">site1:VrJugglerOptions</code> and
<code class="literal">site2:VrJugglerOptions</code> where
<code class="literal">site1</code> and <code class="literal">site2</code> (the
namespaces) are common identifiers for two different VR installations in the
same organization.</p>
<p>The reference identifier is used for matching purposes within the
collection of all known stanzas. To perform this matching, the identifier can
utilize the Python regular expression syntax. For those users not familiar
with regular expressions, simpler shell-style glob patterns are allowed.
For example, valid paths (those containing a root and references to one or
more children) from our example above might be
<code class="literal">site1:VrJugglerOptions/*</code> or
<code class="literal">site1:VrJugglerOptions/Input*</code>. To index within a
collection of matches returned by a pattern, the syntax is to use the
<code class="literal">@</code> symbol followed by a zero-based integer index.
For example, <code class="literal">site1:VrJugglerOptions/Input*@2</code>
would extract the third child under
<code class="literal">site1:VrJugglerOptions</code> whose name matches
<code class="literal">Input*</code>.</p>
