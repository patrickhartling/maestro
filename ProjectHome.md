# Maestro #

Maestro is a client/server architecture intended to provide easy methods to launch applications across a cluster and to manage a cluster. Maestro provides a single coherent view of the entire cluster through a cross-platform GUI application written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) using [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro). Each application that can be launched on the cluster has an associated configuration file (called a "stanza") that stores all needed information.
